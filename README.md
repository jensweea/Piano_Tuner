# Piano Tuner

If you want to tune your piano but don't want to pay for an expensive app, this Python script is for you!

## Introduction

I assume you found your way here because you wanted to tune your piano yourself. Maybe you found a free instrument and wanted to give it a go.  
Maybe you're fixing an inherited instrument. Maybe you just felt like tuning your normal one yourself.

## Prerequisites

### New to Python?

You need Python on your computer to use this script. There are many videos out there that tell you how to set it up on your PC. Follow a recent one.

### Installing Requirements

Assuming you now have Python on your PC:

The first thing you want to do is install the requirements according to `requirements.txt`.

Use the following command to do so:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now it should be as simple as running complete_script.py and follow the instructions.

Please note: All use of this software is your own responsibility. If you use this program and mess up your instrument, don't come running. 
By using this software to attempt to tune an instrument you acknowledge that all damage to your instrument is your own fault. 
If someone is forcing, coercing, or otherwise manipulating you to use this software to tune any instrument, you should probably reevaluate your relationship with that person.

Small disclaimer: I made Copilot make this in one afternoon. If you think it's shit please open a copilot chat and tell them to fix it. 

Best Regards,
Jens
